# Customer Segmentation

## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a vital process in marketing of dividing a broad of customers into groups based on shared characteristics. This process explores underlying useful information in the customer data, increasing sales, customer satisfaction, and more. The data used in this repository is obtained from The UCI Machine Learning Repository. Here is the link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail. First, I built an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report to get familiar with the dataset. Later, I created a classification model using KNN to segment the customers into groups and concluded interesting results. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is a process of investigating the raw dataset to discover patterns and anomalies. Also, EDA should be able to answer some basic business problems that give readers a fundamental understanding of the dataset. In the EDA, there are three sections: descriptive statistics, data preprocessing, and data exploration. In the data exploration part, I explored the dataset column by column and found the answers to basic business problems such as "best-sold product", "biggest customers", "total revenue", etc. I also visualized the results with tables and graphs to let readers have a better interpretation of the data.
