# Customer Segmentation

## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a vital process in marketing of dividing a broad of customers into groups based on shared characteristics. This process explores underlying useful information in the customer data, increasing sales, customer satisfaction, and more. The data used in this repository is obtained from The UCI Machine Learning Repository. Here is the link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail. First, I built an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report to get familiar with the dataset. Later, I created a classification model using KNN to segment the customers into groups and concluded interesting results.
