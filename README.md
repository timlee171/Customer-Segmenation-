# Introduction
In today's competitive e-commerce landscape, understanding customer behavior is essential for driving sales and fostering loyalty. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis allows businesses to categorize customers based on purchasing patterns, identifying high-value segments and those at risk of disengagement. By leveraging these insights, e-commerce companies can tailor their marketing strategies, offering personalized promotions and targeted different customer groups based on their needs. This approach enhances customer engagement and optimizes marketing efforts, ultimately leading to improved sales performance and long-term growth.



## Objectives
I aim to explore the transactional dataset with RFM analysis and further classify the customers to gain business insight. By analyzing the customer data, we intend to:
* Identify high-value customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.
* Develop personalized engagement strategies to nurture customer relationships.
* Implement effective retention tactics to reduce customer churn.
* Optimize marketing resource allocation by focusing on high-potential customer segments.
* Gain a deeper understanding of customer preferences and trends.

## RFM Analysis
RFM analysis is a common marketing technique to use data based on existing customer transactional data to predict consumer behavior. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value. The three factors are key metrics for discovering customer's preferences and habits. 

* Recency: the time elapsed since a customer's last purchase, indicating how recently they engaged with the brand.

* Frequency: the number of purchases a customer has made, providing a measure of customer loyalty and engagement.

* Monetary value: the total amount a customer has spent, reflecting their overall contribution to revenue.

With RFM analysis, businesses can leverage customer insights to develop effective marketing campaigns by targeting specific groups of existing customers. This approach not only helps identify high-value and loyal customer segments but also allows businesses to concentrate their efforts on retaining and nurturing these relationships. Ultimately, RFM analysis empowers companies to enhance customer engagement and drive sustainable growth.
